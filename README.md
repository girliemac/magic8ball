This is a visual demonstration of how the HTML5 device oprentation works.
See the W3C specification at: http://www.w3.org/TR/orientation-event/

Best to try on the mobile browsers that support device orientation and 3D transform.
e.g. iOS Safari, Android browser 3+, Chrome for Android, Firefox Mobile.
The demo works on Opera Mobile, however, the triabgle does not animate in 3D.
